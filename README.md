## About  
Concatenation is a 1.20.1 modpack with four starting pathways to choose from technology to magic to carve a unique path through a branching questline.

Each mod is represented by a pathway and its corresponding tarot cards, each of which can be acquired through progression. The goal of Concatenation is to add together all of the pathways and learn the secret of The World arcana.

## Features  
- Four unique starting branching pathways.
- Branching questline structure for guided progression.  
- Each mod is represented and locked behind a tarot card
- Emphasis on **addition of all pathways**—not just one—in order to learn “The World Arcana”.  
- Compatible with multiplayer.

## Technical Requirements  
- Minecraft version: **1.20.1**
- Mod loader: **Forge**
- Recommended RAM allocation: **4-12 GB** (depending on system specs). On lower-spec computers you may want to lower graphical settings or disable shaders.
