## General Guidelines
You can contribute to Concatenation by making a pull request in ReversTeams' Github repository.

## Modding Guidelines

Banned mods

-Avaritia
-Sophisticated Storage
-Sophisticated Backpacks
-Ultimine (configured but not installed by default)
-Mystical Agriculture
-Tom's Simple Storage

Mods planned for other packs
-Mana & Artifice
-Hexcasting

Custom items and blocks are not added via KubeJS or Multiblocked2, but via custom mods, the primary one being Concatenation Core.

## Writing Guidelines
Concatenation quests follow Eleonore's story through the book "Eleonore's Travels".

### General Guidelines

#### Introduction
Eleonore is the author of Eleonore’s Travels, although is not the only source of information within the book. She often refers to other individuals she meets throughout her travels and there are various suspicious pages and notes stuck on top of the journal, not written by Eleonore herself.

Eleonore’s travels takes her through most of the tarot and her fame increases throughout her journey. She is the first to obtain The Justice card and The Devil card, no one having obtained it before. 

She however does not hold the Error or Prudence cards, has never witnessed anomalies or Purgatory, all events that have occurred after the writing of the original Eleonore’s Travels.

#### Writing General Instructions
Eleonore’s own notes are generally written in the following format:
First is a description of the subject of the journal entry in question in 1-3 sentences depending on the complexity at hand. 

Then is a description of some primary ways to obtain the item. If applicable, next is how the subject works. This may take from 2-10 sentences.

Finally, there is a little anecdote or story drawn from her travels, which may include advice. This may take from 2-6 sentences.

Smaller subjects such as simple materials may take less writing than multiblock articles, weapon articles, etc.

#### Concreteness
Characters have their defined colour in the writing. See the character colour section for more.

Each pathway questline should more or less be a contained story arc. For instance, The Sun questline should be about her time in Sparkon.

#### English Conventions
English (UK) is preferred over English (US). This means different spelling such as armour over armor, colour over color, aluminium over aluminum, etc. Oxford commas are in use.

These conventions do not apply to translations of the quests in other languages.

### Concatenation Specificities

#### Eleonore's Personality
Eleonore tries to stay objective for the most part in the book, but does that job quite poorly.

She is quick to complain in frustration and prides herself in finding unique ways of doing various tasks. She has a fair sense of humor. She is adventurous, ambitious, humble, provocative to enemies but often lazy, having obtained certain items in unorthodox ways such as finding her archmage spellbook on the floor. Her playstyle is primarily a builder-adventurer.

#### Character Colours
Eleonore is white.
Unknown is dark green.
Van is dark cyan.
Santiago is red.
Fala is gold orange.
Nyxil is cyan.
Karl (The Emperor) is dark purple.

More characters can be added with a unique colour. Characters who do not directly speak in the questbook do not need a unique colour.

#### Images
Images can be added to the questbook, but unless the texture is already found in one of the existing mods, it must be added to Concatenation Core. Use images sparingly.
